# Lita_Class_Documentation
This is where I document my first project while learning data analysis with the Incubator Hub. 

### Project Overview
This project helped to enhance my skills in Microsoft Excel, Power BI and SQL. i have gained deeper knowledge and understanding of data analysis, visualization, and database management through practical applications.

### Data sources
The data sources were gotten from the facilitators of the class and additional data from online sources like Kaggle for practise

### Tools and Techniques
-Microsoft Excel was used to utilize advanced functions and formulas, create pivot tables and analyze dataset effectively.

-SQL sever was used to write complex data queries, perform data manipulation and to analyze data effectively.

-Power BI was used for data visulizataion.

-GitHub was used for building portfolio.

### Steps Taken
Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned using excel by handling missing values, removing of duplicates and reforming columns for consistency. The Pivot table was also used to surmmarise the dataset.

Data Analysis: improved ability to analyze large dataset using SQL and Excel.
```Excel
=AVERAGEIF(C8:C27,C20,D8:D27)
```

```SQL
SELECT SUM(SALARY) AS TOTALSALARY FROM SALARY
```

Data visualization:  developed skills in creating interactive visualizations with Power BI.
